You just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais

Let's translate those amounts to â‚¬ :D
'''
pesos = int(input("How much do you have left in pesos? "))
soles = int(input("How much do you have left in soles? "))
reais = int(input("How much do you have left in reais? "))
euros = (pesos * 0.046) + (soles * 0.24) + (reais * 0.16)
print("Are you rich or something? Because all your residual money equals to:", euros, "â‚¬!")
