💸 FXIsHere - The "Am I Still Rich?" Calculator 💸
Because nothing says "I had an amazing vacation" like counting leftover foreign currency at 3 AM

🌎 What is this?
Ever come back from an epic South American adventure and realize your pockets are full of colorful money that your local coffee shop won't accept? Yeah, me too.

This revolutionary* Python script helps you figure out if those leftover pesos, soles, and reais make you rich... or if you should have just bought that last empanada at the airport.

*Not actually revolutionary

🎭 Features
🇨🇴 Converts Colombian pesos faster than you can say "aguardiente"
🇵🇪 Transforms Peruvian soles quicker than a llama crossing Machu Picchu
🇧🇷 Calculates Brazilian reais smoother than samba moves at Carnival
💶 Tells you if you're secretly wealthy in Euros (spoiler: probably not)
🎉 Includes motivational messages about your wealth status!

```bash 
python FXIsHere.py
```
Answer the deeply philosophical questions:

"How much do you have left in pesos?"
"How much do you have left in soles?"
"How much do you have left in reais?"
Discover your true net worth in euros and question all your vacation spending decisions

📊 Example Output
How much do you have left in pesos? 50000
